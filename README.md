# brokenPasswordEvaluator
Just another broken Password Evaluator App

Type in your password and hit "Submit" button to see the results.
Use "Reset" button to clear your input, ofc.

MY standard of a strong password:
- Includes 6 or more characters;
- Includes at least a number;
- Includes at least a lowercase letter;
- Includes at least an uppercase letter;
- Includes at least a symbol (white space does not count).

Overall this app is kind of stupid, that's why I call it "broken".
But I made it for practice and fun, in a short amount of time.

Hope you have fun with it! ;)
